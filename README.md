This project aimed to develop a predictive model to identify patients at risk of hospital readmission using administrative and clinical data available during hospitalization.

**The analysis included:**

1.Demographic profile (Age)
2. Hospital stay complexity
3. Prior healthcare system utilization
4. Primary diagnosis
4. Diabetes management indicators

The final selected model was Logistic Regression with adjusted decision threshold (0.4).

**Key Results:**

- ROC-AUC: 0.64
- Recall: 75%
- Precision: 53%

The model successfully identifies approximately 3 out of 4 patients who will be readmitted, prioritizing early detection over strict precision.
