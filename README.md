The file “hospital_readmissions.csv” contains hospital patient data, collected over approximately 10 years, recording multiple characteristics related to hospitalizations, diagnoses, and whether the patient was readmitted or not.

### Objective:
To answer two questions:

1. What factors are associated with a higher risk of readmission? (insights)
2. Can I predict readmission with a simple model? (model + explanation)

### Final Output:

- EDA Notebook + Cleanup
- Modeling Notebook + Evaluation + Explainability
- Dashboard (Tableau)
